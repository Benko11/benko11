description: Harold moved to Royal Woods in 2004. That November, he met Howard at an art exhibit at the community center. They both wore Guy Girard's double-breasted parkas that day, so during coat check, they ended up wearing each others' jackets.

Harold moved to Royal Woods in 2004. That November, he met Howard at an art exhibit at the community center. They both wore Guy Girard's double-breasted parkas that day, so during coat check, they ended up wearing each others' jackets. When they switched back, Howard helped put Harold's jacket on for him, and they fell in love at the touch of a hand.

On their first date, Harold gave Howard an eternal love orchid as a present. However, Howard ended up arranging a complicated maintenance schedule centered around the orchid, and Harold accidentally killed it off repeatedly. This caused him to become insanely paranoid about the orchid, so he ended up replacing it every time he killed it by accident. However, this came to an end when Lincoln and Clyde destroyed the orchid, along with the replacement he was about to put in its place.
