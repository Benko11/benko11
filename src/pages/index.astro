				Hey there! My name is Benjamin, I am 25 years old, and I am a
				wanna-be artist, writer, web developer, UNIX enthusiast, but most
				importantly, I am me.
			</p>
			<p>
				I like creating unique experiences, retro terminals, messing with
				computers, listening to music, and I am trying hard to get myself
				to reading books, which I used to read a lot in the past, but
				those times are long gone, sadly.
